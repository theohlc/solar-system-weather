# Solar::System::Weather

Solar System Weather is a simple educational/weather tool. It brings a bit of fun to the weather. Based on the current temperature for a location, that spot will be compared to the average data for another planet in our solar system.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solar-system-weather'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install solar-system-weather

## Usage
After you have installed the gem, enter into the solar-system-weather-directory
from the solar-system-weather directory:
> ruby bin/run
Then follow the instructions in the terminal. A zip code works best for your location, as there may be multiple cities/town that share a name. However, if you want to use locations outside the US, the city name must be used.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
